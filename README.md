# kotlin-self-study
Welcome to follow Test Automation Engineer's learning some Kotlin programming from the scratch :)

This Kotlin self-study project started on Valentine's Day 14.2.2020. I participated at the <a href="https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/">Mimmit Koodaa</a> 2020 launch and there were some amazing and inspiring speakers at the event, who encouraged learning more on things you know nothng about.

I have not particularly liked Android development nor the IDEs such as Android Studio, but I hope this learning process will be things related to Android more likeable. With Kotlin, I'll start from zero since I have not previous experience related to it.

So, this is a test engineerâ€™s learning diary to Kotlin. Let's start with the basics.
