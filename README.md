# Kotlin self-study project

Welcome to follow how Test Automation Engineer is learning Kotlin programming from the scratch :)

This Kotlin self-study project started on Valentine's Day 14.2.2020. I participated at the [Mimmit Koodaa](https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/) 2020 launch just for fun and there were some amazing and inspiring speakers at the event, who encouraged to learn more on things you know nothing about.

I have not particularly enjoyed Android testing nor the IDEs such as Android Studio, but I hope this learning process will make things related to Android more likeable. I have previously coding experience with C++, Java, JavaScript and Python, but I'll start from zero with Kotlin since I don't have any previous experience related to it.

So, to follow the project, see my [learning diary to Kotlin](kotlin-learning-diary.md).

## Summary - What I have learned from this project so far

### February 2020: Start of the project

I learned to install and use IDEs and code editors and their plugins suitable for Kotlin development, search information about Kotlin's syntax and features from the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) , solve problems, create small [programming tasks](programming-tasks.md) for a certain purpose in order to learn a feature, search and evaluate learning material suitable for this project and create and run unit tests in Kotlin & JUnit 4. I learned the basics of Kotlin in terms of variables, functions, classes, collections and control flow, I learned how to write and refactor Kotlin code, how to convert Java code to Kotlin code and how to code a simple todo app in Kotlin.

### March & April 2020: Creating a basic online Kotlin learning material in Finnish

I am attending an online course which covers the basics of learning material production. To complete the course, I have to create a learning material for any subject, so I chose to create a learning material that covers the basics of Kotlin in Finnish. I am planning to finish it during Easter, because due to Covid-19 outbreak also in Finland, we are not allowed to leave the Helsinki Capital Area so there is plenty of time to study.

## To learn Kotlin I have

- read online articles, tutorials, Kotlin documentation and language guide
- read chapters in books
- watched conference talks and YouTube videos
- coded with IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio
- coded in Kotlin
- coded in Java
- made lots of errors when coding
