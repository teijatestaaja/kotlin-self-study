# Kotlin self-study project

Welcome to follow Test Automation Engineer's learning some Kotlin programming from the scratch :)

This Kotlin self-study project started on Valentine's Day 14.2.2020. I participated at the <a href="https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/">Mimmit Koodaa</a> 2020 launch and there were some amazing and inspiring speakers at the event, who encouraged learning more on things you know nothing about.

I have not particularly enjoyed Android testing nor the IDEs such as Android Studio, but I hope this learning process will make things related to Android more likeable. I have coding experience with Java, JavaScript and Python, but I'll start from zero with Kotlin since I don't have any previous experience related to it.

So, to follow the project, see my [learning diary to Kotlin](kotlin-learning-diary.md).
