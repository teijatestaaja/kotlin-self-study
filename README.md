# Kotlin self-study project

Welcome to follow Test Automation Engineer's learning some Kotlin programming from the scratch :)

This Kotlin self-study project started on Valentine's Day 14.2.2020. I participated at the [Mimmit Koodaa](https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/) 2020 launch and there were some amazing and inspiring speakers at the event, who encouraged to learn more on things you know nothing about.

I have not particularly enjoyed Android testing nor the IDEs such as Android Studio, but I hope this learning process will make things related to Android more likeable. I have previously coding experience with C++, Java, JavaScript and Python, but I'll start from zero with Kotlin since I don't have any previous experience related to it.

So, to follow the project, see my [learning diary to Kotlin](kotlin-learning-diary.md).

## What I have learned from this project

With this self-organized self-study project, I have learned to

- install and use IDEs and code editors and their plugins suitable for Kotlin development
- search information about Kotlin's syntax and features from the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)
- solve problems
- create small [programming tasks](programming-tasks.md) for a certain purpose in order to learn a feature
- search learning material suitable for this project
- evaluate learning material suitable for this project
