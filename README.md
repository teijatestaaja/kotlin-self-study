# Kotlin self-study project

Welcome to follow how Test Automation Engineer is learning Kotlin programming from the scratch :)

This Kotlin self-study project started in March 2020. While in quarantine, I started learning how to play piano as well as learning programming in Kotlin. I have previous coding experience with Python, Java, JavaScript and C++, but I'll start from zero with Kotlin since I don't have any previous experience related to it or Android development.

To follow the project, see my 
- [learning diary to Kotlin Basics](kotlin-learning-diary.md)
- [150 exercises completed in Kotlin](150-exercises/README.md)
