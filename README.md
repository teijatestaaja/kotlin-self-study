# kotlin-self-study
Test engineer learning some Kotlin programming from the scratch

This Kotlin self-study project started on Valentine's Day 14.2.2020. I participated at the <a href="https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/">Mimmit Koodaa</a> 2020 launch and there were some amazing and inspiring speakers at the event. I especially remember 
<a href="https://koodarikuiskaaja.fi/">Elisa Heikura's</a> speech Who are you fooling? as well as the keynote speaker 
<a href="https://laurakokkarinen.com">Laura Kokkarinen's</a> speech "From Zero to Hero".
I'm not going to fool anyone here, but I'll start from zero with Kotlin. This is a test engineerâ€™s learning diary to Kotlin.
