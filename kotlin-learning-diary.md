## Where to learn Kotlin

After searching and evaluating online material related to Kotlin, I learned that Kotlin language was developed in 2011 by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), a software development company headquartered in Czech Republic. In May 2019 [Google announced](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/kotlin-is-now-googles-preferred-language-for-android-app-development/) that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android application developers. Also, according to [some statistics](http://codinginfinite.com/top-programming-languages-2020-stats-surveys), with the growth of Android, support of Google and with clean and short syntax Kotlin is a good choice to learn as a programming language for Android development.

I also learned that there are many tutorials, guidelines, online courses and Youtube videos on Kotlin. Most of it seems to be in English, since I could not find any tutorials in Finnish. The best materials for learning Kotlin online are maintained by the [Kotlin Foundation](https://kotlinlang.org/foundation/kotlin-foundation.html), which *"was created by JetBrains and Google with the mission to protect, promote and advance the development of the Kotlin programming language."*

Here is a list of online materials I think are useful when self-learning Kotlin:

## First program (Tasks 1 to 3)

For [the first programming task](programming-tasks.md#task-1) I installed the [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/) and downloaded [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). For [the second programming task](programming-tasks.md#task-2) I downloaded [Kotlin plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathiasfrohlich.Kotlin) and [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) for my favourite code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). For [the third programming task](programming-tasks.md#task-3) I also downloaded the latest [standalone version of the Kotlin complier](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.3.61).

As a result, I created my first hello world program in Kotlin with IntelliJ IDEA

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello world!")
}
```

With the basic hello world program, I learned how to

- make a basic Kotlin project in IntelliJ IDEA
- create a new Kotlin file (.kt file) by right-clicking src folder
- run a Kotlin program with IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code and a command prompt
- set up a Kotlin standalone compiler

I used the following learning materials

- [Tutorial: Getting Started with IntelliJ IDEA](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html)
- [Video: Kotlin - Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeVl8fXteI0)
- [Tutorial: Working with the Command Line Compiler](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)
